This plugin allows you to assign a theme to a specific category.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to assign a theme to a specific category. It is actually @MikeLopez's code, I just tweaked it to work on WordPress 3+.

This version adds child theme capability, and the ability to assign a theme to a new category as it is created. It also ignores pages and the home page, so the current theme is applied there.
